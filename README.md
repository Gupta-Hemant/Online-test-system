# Online test systen
The Online test System project aims to develop a robust, web-based platform for creating, administering, and evaluating tests online using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, with XAMPP for easy administration. This system will offer secure user authentication, providing role-based access for students and administrators. Administrators will have a comprehensive interface for creating and managing tests, with support for various question types and a categorized question bank. Tests can be scheduled with specific start and end times, and time limits can be set for individual exams. The user interface will be responsive, ensuring accessibility across different devices, and will include features like a timer display for time-limited exams. The platform will also secure the test environment to prevent cheating, with real-time progress saving to avoid data loss due to connectivity issues. Evaluation features will include automatic grading for objective questions and a manual grading interface for subjective ones, with instant results for objective questions and detailed analytics for performance reporting. The system will be built using modern web technologies, with the frontend developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend powered by PHP, with MySQL as the database. XAMPP will facilitate easy setup and administration of the server environment.
